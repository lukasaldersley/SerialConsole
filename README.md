This is my attempt at creating an easy to use simple Serial reader.
The Design was inspired by the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
To build this yourself download the jSerialComm jar file from https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/ and place it in lib/
(for use with Visual studio code, for other development envoiremnments just make sure to include the jSerialComm jar in your buildpath)
